    This function is robust to keys that are stored as int or str in the
    dictionary. It will try the key as-is, then as a string, then as an int
    (when possible). If the dictionary is falsy or the key is not found,
    return an empty list to make template loops safe.

    Usage: {{ dictionary|get_item:key }}
